So, we decided to run this image through [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/). 

We opened up the color levels menu.

If you look closely, you'll see that while all of the shades of gray seem evenly spaced, except for one missing one.

We adjust one of the two arrows in order to get the shade of the color that was missing.

As you can see, the missing color has a shading of 80, and 80 is 50 in hex, therefore the flag was #505050
